# Paramiko

Paramiko is a pure-Python (2.7, 3.4+) implementation of the SSHv2 protocol, providing both client and server functionality. It provides the foundation for the high-level SSH library [Fabric](https://www.fabfile.org/), which is what we recommend you use for common client use-cases such as running remote shell commands or transferring files.
